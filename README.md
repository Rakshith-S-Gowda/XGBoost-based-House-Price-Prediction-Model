XGBoost-based House Price Prediction Model - Documentation
Introduction
The XGBoost-based House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project that leverages the XGBoost regression algorithm to predict housing prices. It covers end-to-end data science workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training with XGBoost Regressor
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization
- Predictions on new/unseen data
Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- XGBoost-based House Price Prediction Model.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook containing code and workflow
- data/ : (optional) dataset folder
Requirements
To run this project, install the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook "XGBoost-based House Price Prediction Model.ipynb"
2. Execute the cells step by step:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and evaluate the model
- Predict house prices on test data
Example Workflow
Input: Housing dataset with features such as area, number of rooms, and location
Output: Predicted house price

Example:
Input → [2500 sq.ft, 4 rooms, Urban area]
Predicted Price → $350,000
Future Improvements
- Develop a web app interface using Flask/Django
- Deploy as a REST API or interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Automate feature engineering and compare multiple models
- Expand to handle larger and real-world datasets
